Hello! Thank you for looking at this application. As the title states, this is an app that will show you random pictures of cats, because cats are life!

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

These technologies were used in order to better learn how to use them, and show knowledge in this area before a React JS course.

This application also used theCatApi.com to obtain pictures of cats.

To run application simply download the code to your machine and open using your editor of choice.

Lessons Learned:
•	Fetching data from an API using a ‘try…catch’ block
•	Navigating through different API models 
•	Displaying data from an API onto a page

This was an awesome opportunity to practice with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The research was extensive to try to find the right API model. I acquired experience working with APIs and displaying fetched data onto a page. 

I hope this tiny project shows you how I went about making an API call.
