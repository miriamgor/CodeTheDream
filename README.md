5. Lessons Learned:
•	Fetching data from an API using a ‘try…catch’ block
•	Navigating through different API models 
•	Displaying data from an API onto a page

This was an awesome opportunity to practice with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The research was extensive to try to find the right API model. I acquired experience working with APIs and displaying fetched data onto a page. 

I hope this tiny project shows you how I went about making an API call.
